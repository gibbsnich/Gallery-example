# Gallery example
This is how I want the gallery app ... simple.


The app supports 5.0+ devices.

Features:

- Images with location data is shown on a map
- Play videos and gifs;
- Long click on media pager will show bottom sheet with infos and actions;
- Crop, share, set as wallpaper or delete media;

**Message for translators:**

- Don't include strings marked untranslatable, i.e those with translatable="false";

- Don't forget to precede apostrophes by 
```
\
```

Thanks!:)
